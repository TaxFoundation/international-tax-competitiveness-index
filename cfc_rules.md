# CFC Rules Model
The averaging function in `05_cfc_rules.R` creates the  `cfc_rules` variable. The inputs are the `cfc_rules_2014.csv`,`cfc_rules_2015.csv`,`cfc_rules_2016.csv`,`cfc_rules_2017.csv`,`cfc_rules_2018.csv`,`cfc_rules_2019.csv`, `cfc_rules_2020.csv`, `cfc_rules_2021.csv`, `cfc_rules_2022.csv`, `cfc_rules_2023.csv`, and `cfc_rules_2024.csv` files in the `/source-data` folder and the output is the `cfc_rules_data.csv` file in the `/intermediate-outputs` folder.

Each countryâ€™s score in this subcomponent is based on three aspects of controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules: 
1. Whether a country has CFC regulations; 
2. whether CFC rules apply to passive income or all income;  
3. the breadth of exemptions from the general CFC rules. Countries receive the best score if they do not have CFC rules; and

Countries with CFC rules that have exemptions or only apply to passive income or income associated with non-genuine arrangements receive a better score. Countries score worst if they have CFC rules that apply to all income, have no exemptions, and do not have a general minimum tax rule for foreign earnings. 

Zero is the best score. 

The value of the `cfc_rules` variable is a simple average of three variables:

## `exists`: determines if the country has CFC rules or not.

    Equal to 1 if CFC rules exist and 0 if CFC rules do not exist.

## `active`: determines if the country's CFC regime taxes active income

    Equal to 1 if CFC rules apply to active income; equal to 0 if they apply only to passive income or the country does not have a CFC regime; equal to 0.5 if there is a formula based on a share of passive income that triggers full inclusion or the country exempts CFCs with substantial activities.

## `no_exemption`: determines if the country has exemptions to its CFC regime

    Equal to 1 if CFC rules do not have exemptions; equal to 0 if there are exemptions for countries (including based on an effective or statutory rate test) or if there are no CFC rules; equal to 0.5 if there is a formula based on a share of passive income that triggers full inclusion.

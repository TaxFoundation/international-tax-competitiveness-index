## **Consumption Taxes**

* **`vat_rate`** For years up to 2019 the source for the VAT rates is OECD, "Value Added Tax/Goods and Services Tax (VAT/GST) (1976-2019)," http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database/. For 2020, the source is PwC, "Quick Charts: Value-added tax (VAT) rates," https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/quick-charts/value-added-tax-vat-rates.

* **`vat_threshold`** For years up to 2019 the source for the VAT thresholds is OECD, "Value Added Tax/Goods and Services Tax (VAT/GST) (1976-2019)," http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database/. For 2020, the VAT registration thresholds were researched individually based on the following sources: Avalara, "EU VAT registration thresholds 2020," https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/eu-vat-rules/eu-vat-number-registration/vat-registration-threshold.html; European Commission, "Taxes in Europe Database," https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/tedb/splSearchForm.html; and EY, "Worldwide VAT, GST and Sales Tax Guide 2020," April 24, 2020, https://www.ey.com/en_gl/tax-guides/worldwide-vat--gst-and-sales-tax-guide-2020.

* **`vat_base`** For years up to 2016 the source for the VAT Revenue Ratio is OECD, "Consumption Tax Trends 2018," Dec. 5, 2018, https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/consumption-tax-trends-2018_ctt-2018-en#page92; https://doi.org/10.1787/888933890122. For the years 2017 and 2018, the VAT Revenue Ratio was calculated using the following formula in line with the OECD's calculations: VRR = VAT Revenue/[(Consumption - VAT revenue) x standard VAT rate]. Consumption = Final Consumption Expenditure (Heading P3) in the OECD national accounts. VAT rates used are standard rates applicable as of 1 January of each year. For Canada, the VRR calculation includes federal VAT only. For the years up to 2016, the OECD adjusted the annual final consumption expenditure in national accounts for Canada, Japan and New Zealand to ensure matching between the fiscal year for the VAT revenue and the civil year for final consumption figures. This adjustment was not made in the own calculations for the years 2017 and 2018. For Australia and Greece there was no 2018 VAT revenue data available as of June 1, 2020, and thus their 2017 VAT Revenue Ratios were copied to 2018.

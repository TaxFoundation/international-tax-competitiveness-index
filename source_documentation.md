## **Consumption Taxes**

* **`vat_rate`** OECD, "Value Added Tax/Goods and Services Tax (VAT/GST) (1976-2021): VAT/GST: standard and any reduced rates (2021)," http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database/.

* **`vat_base`**  The VAT Revenue Ratio was calculated using the following formula in line with the OECD's VRR calculations: VRR = VAT Revenue/[(Consumption - VAT revenue) x standard VAT rate]. Consumption = Final Consumption Expenditure (Heading P3) in the OECD national accounts. VAT rates used are standard rates applicable as of January 1 of each year. For Canada, the VRR calculation includes federal VAT only. The calculations are based on the following OECD source: OECD, "Consumption Tax Trends 2018," Dec. 5, 2018, https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/consumption-tax-trends-2018_ctt-2018-en#page92 (the relevant table can be downloaded using the following link: https://doi.org/10.1787/888933890122). The 2020 edition of the OECD publication "Consumption Tax Trends" includes OECD VRR numbers up to 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1787/888934220135); however, the downloadable data does not include the underlying calculations.

The IMF's Investment and Capital Stock Database usually does not get updated annually, so if there is no recent update the variable “Capital Formation” in IMF’s IFS database is used to construct the missing years (IMF, “International Financial Statistics (IFS), Gross Domestic Product and Components selected indicators,” https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=61545852).

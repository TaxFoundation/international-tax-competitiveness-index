# International Tax Competitiveness Index

The Tax Foundation’s [International Tax Competitiveness Index](http://taxfoundation.org/article/international-tax-competitiveness-index) (ITCI) measures the degree to which the 34 OECD countries’ tax systems promote competitiveness through low tax burdens on business investment and neutrality through a well-structured tax code. The ITCI considers more than forty variables across five categories: Corporate Taxes, Consumption Taxes, Property Taxes, Individual Taxes, and International Tax Rules.

The ITCI attempts to display not only which countries provide the best tax environment for investment but also the best tax environment to start and grow a business.

## Methodology

The ITCI is a relative ranking of the competitiveness and neutrality of the tax code in each of the 34 OECD countries. It utilizes over 40 variables across five categories: corporate tax, consumption taxes, property taxes, individual taxes, and international tax rules. Each category has multiple subcategories, and each subcategory holds a number of the 40 variables. For example, the consumption tax category contains three subcategories: rate, base, and complexity. The consumption tax base subcategory then has three variables: consumption tax as a percentage of total consumption, deduction limitations, and VAT threshold.

The ITCI is designed to measure a country’s tax code on its relative competitiveness rather than on an absolute measurement. This means that a score of 100 does not signify the absolute best possible tax code but the best tax code among the 34 OECD countries. Each country’s score on the ITCI represents its relative distance from the best country’s score.

### The Calculation of the Variable, Subcategory, and Category Scores

First, the standard deviation and average of each variable is calculated. The standard deviation measures the average distance of a country’s tax variables from the mean among all 34 countries. For example, the average corporate income tax rate across the 34 OECD countries is 25.3 percent with a standard deviation of 6 percentage points. This means that on average, an OECD country’s corporate tax rate is 6 percentage points away from the mean rate of 25.3 percent.

In order to compare each variable, it is necessary to standardize them, because each variable has a different mean and standard deviation. To standardize the variables, each observation is given a normalized score. This sets every variable’s mean to 0 with a standard deviation of 1. Each country’s score for each variable is a measure of its distance from the mean across all countries for that variable. A score of 0 means a country’s score is equal to the average, a score of -1 means it is one standard deviation below average, and a score of 1 is one standard deviation above average.

The score for the corporate tax rate demonstrates this process. Of the 34 OECD countries, the average corporate income tax rate is 25.3 percent, and the standard deviation is 6 percentage points. The United States’ corporate tax rate normalized score is -2.32,64 or 2.32 standard deviations less competitive than the average OECD country. In contrast, Ireland’s tax rate of 12.5 percent is 2.20 standard deviations more competitive than the average OECD country.

The next step is to combine variable scores in order to calculate subcategory scores. Within subcategories, each individual variable’s score is equally weighted and added together. For instance, the subcategory of cost recovery includes six variables: loss carryback, loss carryforward, the present discounted value of depreciation schedules for machines, industrial buildings, and intangibles, and inventory accounting method. The scores for each of these six variables are multiplied by 1/6, or 16.6 percent, to give them equal weight and then added together. The result is the cost recovery subcategory score.

From here, each category’s score is constructed by combining the scores of each contained subcategory. This is computed by multiplying each subcategory by a weight (all weights are equal) and adding the result together. For example, the score for the corporate rate category is calculated by multiplying the scores of the rate, cost recovery, incentives/complexity subcategories by 33.3 percent and adding them together. This is done for all five categories.

The overall normalized score for each country is calculated by taking each category’s normalized score, multiplying each by 20 percent (equal weight for the five categories), and adding them together.

### Calculating the Final Score

From here, two transformations occur on the category scores and the overall score. First, in order to eliminate any negative values, each category’s score and the overall score is converted to its cumulative distribution value, or p-value. These p-values represent the likelihood that a random country’s score is worse than a given country. For example, the United States’ normalized overall score is -0.423. After converting it, the United States receives a p-value of 33.5 percent. This means that there is a 33.5 percent percent chance that the United States has a better tax system than a random OECD country.

Second, the p-value of the overall and category scores for each country is scaled to 100, relative to the country with the highest p-value overall and in each category. This is done by taking each country’s p-value and dividing it by the highest p-value in each category. For example, Estonia, which has the highest overall p-value of 77.9 percent, receives a final overall score of 100. The United States, which has an overall p-value of 33.5 percent, receives a final overall score of 43.1.
